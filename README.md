# String to integer

A string is a sequence of characters. A string may encode an integer, e.g., "123" encodes 123. In this problem, you are to implement methods that take a string representing an integer and return the corresponding integer, and vice versa. Your code should handle negative integers. You cannot use library functions like parselnt in javascriptImplement string/integer inter-conversion functions. “00123” = 123

# Add one to array of digits

Add one to array of digits
Write a program which takes as input an array of digits (0 to 9) encoding a decimal number D and updates the array to represent the number D + 1. For example, if the input is [1,2,9] then you should update the array to [1,3,0].

# Extension: multiplication
Write a program that takes two arrays representing integers, and re¬ turns an integer representing their product. For example, since 193707721 X -761838257287 = -147573952589676412927, if the inputs are 1,9,3,7,0,7,7,2,1} and (-7,6,1,8,3,8,2,5,7,2,8,7), your function should return (-1,4,7,5,7,3,9,5,2,5,8,9,6,7,6,4,1,2,9,2,7). There could be overflow
